Harmonious Code's internals are currently a complete mess. You have been warned.

To build & use Harmonious Code on Unix-like operating systems:

* Make sure you're running haXe 2.
* Download the PHP documentation from CVS.
* Copy/symlink the phpdoc/phpbook/phpbook-xsl/version.xml file from the 
  PHP documentationinto the data directory as version.xml.
* Run build/test.sh. This will take a while as functions_tokens_cache.hxd is
  built in the data directory. It will also ensure everything's working
  correctly.
* Run build/javascript.sh. The harmoniouscode.js file will be generated
  in htdocs.
* Open htdocs/index.html and try analyzing some PHP code.
* Run build/command_line.sh and pass the path to a PHP file as the first
  parameter. A basic analysis should appear.

No build instructions for Windows yet, but Cygwin + haXe for Windows should
be able to perform the build.
