To build Harmonious Code:

* Make sure you're running haXe 2
* Download the PHP documentation from CVS
* Copy/symlink the phpdoc/phpbook/phpbook-xsl/version.xml file from the 
  PHP documentationinto the data directory
* Run test.sh. This will take a while as functions_tokens_cache.hxd is
  built in the data directory.
